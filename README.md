This is a faithful recreation of the Final Fantasy 7 Menu screen, converted into a personal website to show off my future projects. It mainly uses React and Typescript and tries to be as authentic as possible to the source material.

I also used this project as an excuse to experiment with Tanstack Query and FastAPI, though they aren't really necessary.
